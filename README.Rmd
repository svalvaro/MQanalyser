# MQanalyser

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MQanalyser is to provide the user an interface to interactively analyse their
Proteomics LC-MS/MS output. 

## Installation



You can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BioAlvaro/MQanalyser")
```
## Example

To run it locally:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(MQanalyser)
## basic example code
appDir <- system.file("shiny_app", package = "MQanalyser")

shiny::runApp(appDir)
```

This is how it should look like when you have uploaded your proteinGroups.txt and
the experiment design. Just press Start Analysis...
and Enjoy!
